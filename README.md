# Relevant Radio Replica
An attempt at replicating the UI of the Relevant Radio app

## Description
I have replicated the front-end design of the Relevant Radio app to the best of my ability.

The app is not functional; aside from the navigation bar at the bottom, the buttons do not work.
My goal was simply to create the front-end design of the application and learn about Swift in the process.

## How to View
Download the RelevantRadioReplica folder and open the project in Xcode

## Technologies
- Xcode
- Swift
- SwiftUI
